            <h2>About This Class</h2>
            <p>
			  This class is aimed as a reality check: do we really
			  understand how today's AI and ML systems are built upto
			  and including the design of the underlying GPU codes?
			  We hear stories of GPUs being the central currency of
			  today's computing; wouldn't it be nice to understand GPUs
			  and how one can code-up simple AI and ML systems from
			  scratch to run on them?

			  <br>			  

			  Other examples of software we like to study
			  include various scientific computing
			  software systems such as lossy data compression systems
			  and the software realizing irregular graph algorithms.
			  Even these systems run fast(er) on GPUs---calling for
			  a similar understanding.

			  <br>			  

			  Such software systems are difficult to create, understand, debug
			  and repair. These systems have many
			  interfaces, follow
			  a plethora of conventions regarding number representations, and
			  involve a basic set of parallel programming skills to implement.

			  <br>			  

			  I myself know many things well in this area but  am
				equally eager (as you might be)  to build and run
			  some of these artifacts from scratch myself! I like to take
			  built artifacts apart and reassemble them. I don't have a huge
			  recent track-record of doing this (I've done tons and tons of this
			  over my lifetime---including filing-down epoxy-encrusted
			  circuits to their pins and reassembling them). But it is time for me
			  to change course too! I feel I'll emerge a bit more "genuine"
			  if I engage in such "ablution" at least for a little while.

			  <br>			  

			  Why don't we engage in a grand adventure over a semester where
			  we teach each other? We will present a few real GPU codes to you
			  on day-1 (more will be added as we go along). To help understand these
			  codes better, we will also be presenting some Python codes that either
			  mirror these codes or call upon the GPU codes to then export
			  efficient higher level functions.

			  <br>
			  
			  In other words,
