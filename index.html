            <h2>About This Class</h2>
            <p>
			  The Canvas links to CS 4961 is 
			  <a href="https://utah.instructure.com/courses/1017537"> HERE </a>
			  and that for CS 6961 is
              <a href="https://utah.instructure.com/courses/1021642"> HERE </a>.
			  <strong> We will maintain only the latter, as the requirements are pretty much the same. </strong>
			  The official syllabus page at the UofU is
			  <a href="https://class-tools.app.utah.edu/syllabus/1254/14904/4961-6961-course-template.docx"> HERE. </a>
			  It describes the grading scale, etc. (Basically: 20% for assignments; 30% for participation which
			  includes attendance; and 50% for projects.)
			  <br>
			  <br>			  
			  This course
			  is aimed as a reality check: do we really
			  understand how today's AI and ML systems are built---upto
			  and including the design of the underlying GPU codes?
			  We hear stories of GPUs being the central currency of
			  today's computing; wouldn't it be nice to understand GPUs
			  and how one can code-up simple AI and ML systems from
			  scratch to run on them?

			  <br><br>

			  Other examples of software we like to study
			  include various scientific computing
			  software systems such as lossy data compression systems
			  and the software realizing irregular graph algorithms.
			  Even these systems run fast(er) on GPUs---calling for
			  a similar understanding.


			  <br><br>			  			  

			  Such software systems are difficult to create, understand, debug
			  and repair. These systems have many
			  interfaces, follow
			  a plethora of conventions regarding number representations, and
			  involve a basic set of parallel programming skills to implement.


			  <br><br>			  			  

			  I myself know many things well in this area.
			  <b> But I don't know a ton of things---precisely
				the reason for teaching. Also I know how to
				learn (with your help and interactions) about them! </b>
			  And I know that many experts out there lack this
			  closer-to-the-metal knowledge (no offense meant; they are
			  doing great work---but this sort of a low-level foray is
			  cathartic to all).
			  That is why I am eager (as you also better be) eager  to build and learn.

			  <br><br>
			  
			  Historically, I have liked taking
			  artifacts apart and reassembling them. I don't have a huge
			  <b> recent </b> track-record of doing this (I've done  tons of this
			  over my lifetime, especially before I got busy chasing money---including
			  filing-down epoxy-encrusted
			  circuits to their pins and reassembling them). But it is time for me
			  to change course too! I feel I'll emerge a bit more "genuine"
			  if I engage in such "ablution" at least for a little while.
			  Remember "it is never late"---<b> even for me! :-) </b>


			  <br><br>			  			  

			  Why don't we engage in a grand adventure over a semester where
			  we teach each other? We will present a few real GPU codes to you
			  on day-1 (more will be added as we go along). To help understand these
			  codes better, we will also be presenting some Python codes that either
			  mirror these codes or call upon the GPU codes to then export
			  efficient higher level functions. We will try and
			  understand the precautions
			  taken in erecting the numeric structures and parallelism structures
			  of these codes. Then <b> we will all build different systems, treating
				the disassembly results as a "kit of parts". </b>


			  <br><br>

			  <strong>
              What bugs shall we understand to locate and mitigate?
			  So what systems will we tear down?       See  <a href="#resources">Resources</a>
			  </strong>

	
			  <br><br>

			  

			  			  <strong> I may need to cap this class and choose 
							students who are oriented toward research a bit more. Why?
			  </strong>
						  We will need to access GPUs. Also this class requires the right
						  kind of background. For UGs, we will teach you what you don't know.
						  For Grads, I will prefer students with strong interest in publication
						  (and I may talk 1-1 to assess that). Please show up on day-1 and
						  of course meet me beforehand as you wish and as we find common times to meet.

						  <br> <br>
						  
			  <strong> One may say "I am scared; I hardly know 80% of what you said. How can
				I even do this?"
			  </strong>
			  Fear not!

			  <br>			  
			  <ul>
				<li> I and my TMs (Harvey Dam) and Staff Researcher (Dr. Mark Baranowski) will
				  meet you regularly. </li>
				<li> If you lack the basic GPU chops, you'll be given study material
				  (see for example
				  <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/even-easier-introduction-cuda/"> Mark
					 Harris's Blog </a> with A Colab notebook to explore the above
							<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVDLI/notebooks/blob/master/even-easier-cuda/An_Even_Easier_Introduction_to_CUDA.ipynb"> here </a>).
				  Then
				  you come and present it in class.
				  This is not your traditional class. You do the talking mostly! There will be
				  plenty of 1-1s. </li>
				  <li>
					<b> How each week will go: </b> We will have a meeting with you both during class
					and outside of class. We will teach you stuff 1-1. Then you follow-up and come prepared and
					present. Presentation slides will be longer - you may get 10min for presenting a gist. The
					rest is your learning to do a project!
				</li>
			  </ul>


			  <br>
			  
			  <!---Role of Correctness -->

			  <br>

			  <strong> You may ask "What is in it for me?"
			  </strong>
			  A lot.
			  
			  <br>			  

			  <ul>
				<li> Confidence of deconstructing and reconstructing something serious
				  that powers the world and our lives. </li>
				<li> A realization that things just don't automatically
				  work correctly! Journey this arduous path.				</li>
				<li> Learning in context; GPU programming takes years and years
				  to master; here, we will see some aspects of GPU
				  programming rather well---a different and focus-inducing
				  experience. </li>
				<li> Something publishable. <b> The idea
					is to ride the rough road a little, and then
					switch to a cool project. </b>. For instance,
				  reconstituting some parts of a system you tear down
				  in a new language (Rust?) and/or proving properties---all game.
				</li>

				<li> GRADES: We will give you a passing grade with good participation
				  and nothing else. For a strong grade, do a project,
				  break/recreate something, write a good 10-12 page report.
				  A paper coming out of the classwork after a ton of participation
				  and teaching us a lot (!) is grounds for a solid A.
				  The goals of this course are not set in stone. <b> If you
					push us in the right direction, this will be a fun class. </b>
				  We will promise utmost hard work on our side,
				  <b> esp. given that this course has not been offered
					by me before. I do plan to write a book that captures
					the lessons from this class---hoping to create and
					prototype some chapters during this class. </b>

				</li>

				<li> <b> What you can and cannot do:</b> Please set your goals early with
 				  respect to your starting-point. We will negotiate that. If you achieve your own
				  personal goals, we are done. If, however, you are <b> not planning to show up
					to class and/or participate,</b> this class is not for you. You are allowed
				  to take time off, etc., but after proper communication. In other words,
				treat this class as you would treat your workplace where "playing hooky" is not allowed. </li>
