            <h2>About This Class</h2>
            <p>
			  This class is aimed as a reality check: do we really
			  understand how today's AI and ML systems are built---upto
			  and including the design of the underlying GPU codes?
			  We hear stories of GPUs being the central currency of
			  today's computing; wouldn't it be nice to understand GPUs
			  and how one can code-up simple AI and ML systems from
			  scratch to run on them?

			  <br>
 			  <br>			  

			  Other examples of software we like to study
			  include various scientific computing
			  software systems such as lossy data compression systems
			  and the software realizing irregular graph algorithms.
			  Even these systems run fast(er) on GPUs---calling for
			  a similar understanding.

			  <br>
			  <br>			  			  

			  Such software systems are difficult to create, understand, debug
			  and repair. These systems have many
			  interfaces, follow
			  a plethora of conventions regarding number representations, and
			  involve a basic set of parallel programming skills to implement.

			  <br>
			  <br>			  			  

			  I myself know many things well in this area.
			  <b> But I don't know a ton of things---precisely
				the reason for teaching. Also I know how to
				learn (with your help and interactions) about them! </b>
			  And I know that many experts out there lack this
			  closer-to-the-metal knowledge.
			  That is what I am eager (as you also better be) eager  to build and learn.

			  Historically, I have liked taking
			  artifacts apart and reassembling them. I don't have a huge
			  recent track-record of doing this (I've done  tons of this
			  over my lifetime, especially five decades ago---including
			  filing-down epoxy-encrusted
			  circuits to their pins and reassembling them). But it is time for me
			  to change course too! I feel I'll emerge a bit more "genuine"
			  if I engage in such "ablution" at least for a little while.
			  Remember "it is never late"!

			  <br>
			  <br>			  			  

			  Why don't we engage in a grand adventure over a semester where
			  we teach each other? We will present a few real GPU codes to you
			  on day-1 (more will be added as we go along). To help understand these
			  codes better, we will also be presenting some Python codes that either
			  mirror these codes or call upon the GPU codes to then export
			  efficient higher level functions. We will try and
			  understand the precautions
			  taken in erecting the numeric structures and parallelism structures
			  of these codes. Then <b> we will all build different systems, treating
				the disassembly results as a "kit of parts". </b>

			  <br>
			  <br>			  

			  So what systems will we tear down? 
			  Here are a few examples:
			  <br>
			  <br>			  

			  <ul>
  <li> The autograd function of some simple neural networks, including baby LLMs.</li>
  <li> Various inner layers of neural networks.</li>
  <li> Various lossy compressors and graph algorithm codes.m</li>
			  </ul>


	What shall we study?
			  Here are a few examples:
			  <br>
			  <br>			  

			  <ul>
  <li> How to do backprop through all sorts of layers including auto-encoders. </li>
  <li> How forward and reverse-mode differentiation is realized. </li>
  <li> How numerical precision is handled. </li>
  <li> How threads and warps are organized. </li>
  <li> How special units such as tensor-cores are brought in.</li>
			  </ul>



	What bugs shall we understand to locate and mitigate?
			  <br>
			  <br>			  

			  <ul>
  <li> Rounding errors. </li>
 <li> Floating-point NaNs. </li>
 <li> Data races. </li>
</ul>
			  

			  <strong> I am scared; I hardly know 80% of what you said. How can
				I even do this?
			  </strong>
			  Fear not!
			  <br>
			  <br>			  

			  <ul>
				<li> I and my TMs (Harvey Dam) and Staff Researcher (Dr. Mark Baranowski) will
				  meet you regularly. </li>
				<li> If you lack the basic GPU chops, you'll be given study material. Then
				  you come and present it in class.
				  <b>This is not your traditional class. You do the talking mostly! There will be
					plenty of 1-1s. </b>
				</li>
			  </ul>



			  <strong> What is in it for me?
			  </strong>
			  A lot.
			  <br>
			  <br>			  

			  <ul>
				<li> Confidence of deconstructing and reconstructing something serious
				  that powers the world and our lives. </li>
				<li> A realization that things just don't automatically
				  work correctly! Journey this arduous path.				</li>
				<li> Learning in context; GPU programming takes years and years
				  to master; here, we will see some aspects of GPU
				  programming rather well---a different and focus-inducing
				  experience. </li>
				<li> Something publishable. <b> The idea
					is to ride the rough road a little, and then
					switch to a cool project. </b>. For instance,
				  reconstituting some parts of a system you tear down
				  in a new language (Rust?) and/or proving properties---all game.
				</li>				
</ul>
